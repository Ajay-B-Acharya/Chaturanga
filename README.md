# 📌 Game Overview

Chaturanga uses a three-lane vertical board where every piece moves only forward inside its lane.
The game includes friendly fire, lane-restricted attacks, and a strict summoning system that adds deep strategy.

This repository contains:

*   Complete rulebook
*   Game board layout
*   Movement, attack & summoning mechanics
*   Google AI Studio prompts
*   Antigravity IDE project files
*   Assets and ancient-style UI references

## 🎮 Key Game Features

### 🛡 Friendly Fire (Allowed)

*   Pieces can kill their own teammates if the move rules allow it.
*   This increases strategy and risk.

### 🟦 Lane-Based Movement

*   All pieces move only forward in their own lane.
*   Sideways or backward movement is not allowed unless a special rule exists.

### ✨ Summoning System

*   You can summon pieces only on specific front-facing tiles.
*   You cannot summon a king while your king is alive.
*   If your king dies, you may summon a new king in the allowed lane positions.

### 👑 King Mechanics

*   Kings cannot go into the opponent king’s left-lane starting tile.
*   Kings follow the same forward-movement restriction.
*   Summoning a king is allowed only when your previous king is dead.

### 🧱 Board Layout

*   The board follows a vertical 3-lane structure, matching the reference image.
*   All directions (front, back, left lane, right lane) are defined based on this orientation.
